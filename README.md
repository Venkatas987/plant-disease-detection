🌿 Plant Disease Detection

A web application to detect plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

About the Project

This project leverages deep learning to detect common plant diseases from leaf images. Users can upload an image of a plant leaf, and the application predicts the disease with confidence scores.

The model is trained on a dataset of various plant leaf images and diseases including Tomato, Potato, Corn, and more.


Features

Upload a leaf image and get disease prediction

High accuracy using a CNN model

Simple, interactive web interface built with Streamlit

Supports multiple plant species and disease types


Tech Stack

Python – Programming language

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning framework

OpenCV / Pillow – Image processing

Streamlit – Web interface for deploying the model

Git & GitHub – Version control
